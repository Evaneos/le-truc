# The Plain v1

A minimalist Jekyll theme that focues on writing matters, made with passion for simplicity. A great, white clean theme for personal blog use. Made with [Sass](https://github.com/sass/sass) which automates the compression of the compiled CSS code, and cool **Jekyll layout** by [Anatol Broder](http://jch.penibelst.de/) for compressing the HTML code on-the-fly. Typeface used is [Fira Sans font](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira) by Mozilla.
